This project explores customer spending prediction and segmentation for direct marketing using a dataset of 1,000 customer records with features like age group, gender, income, and past purchasing behavior. The goal was to predict how much customers might spend using regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) and to segment them into meaningful groups with KMeans clustering to support targeted marketing strategies. KMeans clustering identified distinct customer segments useful for targeted campaigns. This repository includes the original dataset, the full Jupyter Notebook with all codes and outputs, and the final report in Word format. Please note that in the Word report the codes and results are included as screenshots to comply with submission guidelines, which makes the word count itself relatively low, but the full original runnable codes are available here in this GitHub for review and evaluation. This project was completed by Ali Jawed Delawari (GH1024093) as part of the B198.C5 module at GISMA University of Applied Sciences to demonstrate practical data science skills for business decision-making.
